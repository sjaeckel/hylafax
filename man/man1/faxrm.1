.TH FAXRM 1 "April 29, 1991"
.SH NAME
faxrm \- remove a facsimile job queued for transmission
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B faxrm
[
.B \-h
.I hostname
]
.IR jobid ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Faxrm
removes one or more facsimile jobs that
are queued for transmission.
A 
.I jobid
is the number printed by
.IR sendfax (1)
when a job is queued for transmission.
This number can also be obtained from
.IR faxstat (1).
.PP
Users can only remove jobs that they
have queued.
(Except the
.I fax
user who can remove any job.)
.PP
By default,
.I faxrm
contacts the facsimile server on the host specified
in the
.B FAXSERVER
environment variable.
This can be overridden with the
.B \-h
option.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B "Job %s removed." 
A confirmation that the operation was completed successfully.
.PP
.B "Job %s not removed: it was not queued."
The specified job was not found in the server's queue.
.PP
.B "Job %s not removed: it is being sent."
The job is being processed by the server and can not be removed.
.PP
.B "Job %s not removed: open failed; check SYSLOG."
.I or
.B "Job %s not removed: unlink failed; check SYSLOG."
The server was unable to do some necessary operation on the 
remote host and so could not remove the job.
More information about what went wrong can be found in the
.IR syslogd (1M)
log file on the server's machine (usually
.IR /usr/adm/SYSLOG ).
.PP
.B "Document for job %s not removed: unlink failed; check SYSLOG."
The job description file was removed, but one or
more of the associated document files was not.
More information can be found in the log file on the server's machine.
.PP
.B "Job %s not removed: could not establish server process owner."
A request was made by the ``fax'' user to remove
a job that it did submit.
This request was not accepted because
the server was unable to deduce the identity under which
it was executing.  That is, there was no password file
entry for the server's effective user id.
This (usually) indicates that the entry in the file
.I /usr/etc/inetd.conf
on the remove machine is setup wrong; see
.IR faxd.recv (1M)
for more information.
.PP
.B "Job %s not removed: you neither own it nor are the fax user."
A request was made to remove a job that the user does not own
(and the user is not the ``fax'' user).
.SH BUGS
It is not possible to remove a job that the server is
actively transmitting (or trying to transmit).
.I Faxrm
must be run on the same host on which the job was
submitted.
