If you are not using the Display PostScript-based imager on a
Silicon Graphics machine, then you need to
build a version of Ghostscript that includes the tiffg3 driver provided
with version 2.6.x and later. 
Ghostscript and its fonts can be found at many public ftp sites around
the Internet.  A good way to find the nearest public ftp site
that has version 2.6.1 is with archie:

<FORM ACTION="@CGIPATH@/archieplexform.pl?query=ghostscript-2.6.1&type=Case+Sensitive+Substring+Match">
<INPUT TYPE=submit>: Click here to use Archie to locate Ghostscript 2.6.1
</FORM>
<P>

To setup Ghostscript you need to:
<OL>
<LI> Create a Makefile (follow the Ghostscript documentation).
<LI> Add "tiffg3.dev" to the list of configured devices.
<LI> Build a <B>gs</B> executable that includes the tiffg3 driver.
<LI> Verify that you have configured your <B>gs</B> executable correctly
by invoking it with the -h option and looking for the tiffg3 driver
in the list of available devices; e.g.
<LISTING>
hyla% gs -h
Aladdin Ghostscript version 2.9.9 (6/23/1994)
Copyright (C) 1990-1994 Aladdin Enterprises, Menlo Park, CA.
Usage: gs [switches] [file1.ps file2.ps ...]
Available devices:
        x11 tiffg3 tiffg4
Search path:
    .
    /usr/local/lib/ghostscript/gs-2.9.7:/usr/local/lib/ghostscript/fonts
Most frequently used switches: (you can use # in place of =)
    -d<name>[=<token>]   define name as token, or true if no token given
    -dNOPAUSE            don't pause between pages
    -g<width>x<height>   set width and height (`geometry'), in pixels
    -q                   `quiet' mode, suppress most messages
    -r<res>              set resolution, in pixels per inch
    -s<name>=<string>    define name as string
    -sDEVICE=<devname>   select initial device
    -sOutputFile=<file>  select output file: embed 268501088 for page #,
                           - means stdout, use |command to pipe
    -                    read from stdin (e.g., a pipe) non-interactively
For more information, see the (plain text) file use.doc
  in the directory (null).
</LISTING>
<LI> Install the <B>gs</B> executable and the associated runtime support code (e.g. ``make install'').
<LI> Install, if necessary, the Ghostscript fonts (these may come
     separately from the Ghostscript source distribution).
</OL>

Beware that in recent versions of Ghostscript the PostScript Level II
support requires the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) distribution; this
software typically comes bundled in an archive separate from the
Ghostscript distribution.  This means that you may need to fetch
three archives to setup a working Ghostscript:

<UL>
<LI> Ghostscript source code
<LI> Ghostscript/IJG code
<LI> Ghostscript fonts
</UL>

Consult the Ghostscript documentation for specifics.

Note that on machines with dynamic shared libraries (e.g. SunOS), if you
link Ghostscript with the X11 device driver and use shared X11
libraries that are not in a standard location, then you may need to
augment the HylaFAX
<B>util/ps2fax.gs.sh</B> script with something of the form:
</EM>

<PRE>
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/R5/lib:/usr/openwin/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</PRE>

<EM>
Beware that while many versions of Ghostscript between 2.6.1
and 3.12 have tiffg3 drivers that purport to support 2D-encoded
facsimile data, none do so correctly.
Versions post-3.12 should generate correct 2D-encoded data.
