<DT>A.
<DD>From time to time it's worthwhile to remind folks
of some things about the software that I give out and my involvement.
I work full time for Silicon Graphics
doing work (that's supposed to be) totally
unrelated to fax software.  HylaFAX (aka FlexFAX)
is a project that I've been working
on, and giving away, for more than 5 years.  I use only SGI equipment.
I do my best to make sure the software functions on non-SGI platforms
solely because I believe that everyone (especially SGI users) benefits
from the widest possible distribution and use of the software.  In
particular, I believe that the more users there are, the more
cross-platform bugs that will be found, the more modems that will be
supported, the more enhancements that will be contributed.  That said,
people should understand that I make an effort only to insure that the
software functions correctly on SGI machines (and in particular, *my* SGI
machines) and that it does what I need.  I am sympathetic to folks with
non-SGI environments and/or with needs that differ from my own.
However, if you want something fixed or want something enhanced, then
you should send me a complete patch so that I can easily understand the
change and integrate it.  Otherwise the problem/enhancement is likely
to be ignored.  Please note also, that if you send me something that
I don't feel belongs in the basic software then I'll likely stick it in
the <A HREF="ftp://sgi.com/sgi/fax/contrib">contrib area on sgi.com</A>.
<P>
In general I spend lots more time on HylaFAX than I should.
I cannot
promise that I will provide timely answers to questions or new
distributions; though people that know me recognize that I try my best
to keep people happy.
<P>
BTW, be sure to check out the
<A HREF="@HTMLPATH@/acknowledge.html">acknowledgements section</A>.
You will see that many people have contributed to this software
besides myself; many more than are listed there.  I really do
appreciate contributions, comments, critiques, etc. despite the brusk
and/or curmudgeonly attitude that often comes across in my notes
