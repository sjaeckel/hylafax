<P>
Just a quick question - what do you use to view incoming faxes?  xv
wants to allocate an 8 bit/pixel bitmap, and takes forever to
display an image on my linux box.  It also doesn't seem to be able
to display anything other than the first page (not that I've looked
real hard).  I had a look through the archives, and found xtiff.
It loads faster, and I hacked it to display lowres faxes in the
right aspect ratio, but it doesn't have a page preview mode (ie,
you can only see a small part of the page at any one time), and it
periodically dumps core in XCreateImage().  What other choices are
available?

<DD>There are at least two solutions:

Many people use the <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+fax2ps">fax2ps</A>
or <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+tiff2ps">tiff2ps</A> programs
together with GNU ghostview; e.g. 
<PRE>
   fax2ps /var/spool/fax/recvq/faxVAAa0051G | ghostview
</PRE>
<P>
There is also 
<A HREF="file://sgi.com/sgi/fax/contrib/faxview/README">faxview</A>,
an unfinished, but usable, X-based viewer in the
contributed software area on sgi.com
