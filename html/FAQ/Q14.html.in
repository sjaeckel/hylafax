<P>
My setup:
<UL>
Linux 1.1.89<BR>
gcc 2.6.2p2  (note -- there is no release of gcc 2.6.3 for Linux yet)<BR>
libc 4.6.27<BR>
libg++ 2.6.2.1<BR>
</UL>
<P>
The problem: make craps out with the following error:
<UL><TT>
ld: Output file requires shared library `libc.so.4'
gcc: Internal compiler error: program ld got fatal signal 6
make: *** [t] Error 1
</TT></UL>

<P>
I have rebuilt HylaFAX using these options.  I no longer had any of the errors.
