<DT>Q.
<DD><I>Faxing TIFF G4 images?</I>
<P>
I have now installed flexfax on and AIX 3.2.5 system using a Miracom modem
and everything works well in the testing so far. ie. sending PS, text files
etc....
<P>
However, my real reason for installing flexfax is to send from our image
system. The image spec is as follows.
<LISTING>
    A4 scanned image
    KIPP TIFF files
    Width x Height: 2448 x 3510
    Number of colours: 2
    DPI: 300 x 300
    Image size inches: 8.16 x 11.70
</LISTING>
I have a copy of image Alchemy which can convert to TIFF G3 I can not 
reduce the resolution, but flexfax will understand that it is a TIFF 
G3 image. Alas I do not have the Alchemy version which can create PS files.
<P>
So my question is,
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>a)<DD>Can flexfax actaully send G4 images and is so what spec.
<DT>b)<DD>If the answer to (a) is no, does anyone feel like changing it 
       so that it can.
<DT>c)<DD>if the answer to (b) is no, is there a TIFF G4 to PS converter out there.
</DL>

<DT>A.
<DD><I>a) Can flexfax actaully send G4 images and is so what spec.</I>
<P>
HylaFAX will not directly send G4 images, they must be converted either
to G3 or to PostScript
(see <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+hylafax">hylafax(1)</A>).
<P>
<I>b) If the answer to (a) is no, does anyone feel like changing it 
       so that it can.</I>
<P>
No, converting formats at the client makes much more sense (based on
experience doing it the other way around).
<P>
<I> c) if the answer to (b) is no, is there a TIFF G4 to PS converter out there.  </I>
<P>
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+fax2ps">fax2ps</A>
should handle G4 images.  Alternatively tiff2ps from the
<A HREF="file://sgi.com/graphics/tiff/HOWTO">TIFF
distribution</A> will handle them.
