<DT>Q.

<P>
I submit a fax. It ends up in the docq directory.
<B>/usr/adm/messages</B> states the following:
<LISTING>
Sep  3 12:39:50 jack FaxServer[20522]: SEND: REJECT docq/doc1.cover+ because: "Can not open file"
Sep  3 12:43:54 jack FaxServer[20522]: SEND: REJECT docq/doc2.cover+ because: "Can not open file"
Sep  3 12:44:18 jack FaxServer[20522]: SEND: REJECT docq/doc3.cover+ because: "Can not open file"
Sep  3 12:45:34 jack FaxServer[20522]: SEND: REJECT docq/doc4.cover+ because: "Can not open file"
Sep  3 12:53:54 jack FaxServer[20522]: SEND: REJECT docq/doc5.cover+ because: "Can not open file"
Sep  3 13:17:35 jack FaxServer[22670]: SEND: REJECT docq/doc6.cover+ because: "Can not open file"

</LISTING>
The files are in the directory owned by uucp and permissions
600, but the file names do not have a "+" at the end of them.
<P>
Of course, at this point the fax is tossed out and mail sent to
the sender.
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>Filenames with a trailing "+" are the converted (imaged) documents
created by processing the submitted PostScript with the 
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+ps2fax">ps2fax</A> converter program
[<CITE>Ed: this was true for FlexFAX but not for HylaFAX; consult
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+hylafax">hylafax(4F)</A>
for up to date information</CITE>].
A converted file may not be opened for many reasons: it was not
created, the permission or owner of the file prevents the fax
server from accessing it, etc.
This problem is almost always caused by the Ghostscript package
being incorrectly installed and/or configured.
Be sure that you have Ghostscript properly installed and that the
submitted cover page is "good PostScript". 
One possible step-by-step method for diagnosing such a problem is
described
