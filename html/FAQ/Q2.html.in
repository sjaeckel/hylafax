<DT>Q.
<DD><I>Why should I use HylaFAX instead of some other fax package?</I>
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>HylaFAX is designed to be very robust and reliable. 
The fax server is designed to guard against unexpected failures in the
software, in the configuration, in the hardware, and in general use.
HylaFAX uses an intelligent scheduling policy that attempts to
recognize different
types of failures and optimize retry attempts.
An important design goal is that users must never worry
about transmit jobs being lost or mishandled:
jobs are either
completed successfully or the submitter is notified what happened
to their job <EM>and why the job failed</EM>.
If you are
willing to shepherd your facsimile transmissions then other software
packages may be more suitable for you. 
<P>
HylaFAX supports a wide variety of modems and is designed to support
<STRONG>any</STRONG> Class 1, Class 2, or Class 2.0 modem
<EM>without modification to the source code</EM>.
If you have a modem that provides only
a Class 1 interface then HylaFAX is likely to be the only freely
available software package that will work with your modem.
<P>
HylaFAX supports multiple modems and heavy traffic load.  If you
expect to send or receive more than 1 or 2 facsimile a day, then
HylaFAX is likely to be the best package for you to use.
<P>
HylaFAX is expressly designed to be highly configurable <EM>without
modification or access to the source code</EM>.
The software comes with extensive documentation to assist in understanding
how the software functions and how to configure it.
<P>
HylaFAX is freely available.  There is no GNU copyleft policy.
There are no requests for remuneration,
constraints on use, or constraints on incorporation into products
(compare this with other ``<I>freely available fax packages</I>'').
The software copyright only restricts the use of the author's
