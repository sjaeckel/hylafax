<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>"CONNECT 19200" indicates that the modem established a data connection,
not a fax connection.  If a fax connection was established, "+FCON"
should have been returned.
If you did in fact reach a fax machine only to establish a data connection
then your modem probably was placed the call in Class 0 instead of
Class 1 or 2; check your configuration file to be certain outgoing
fax calls are dialed in the proper class.
