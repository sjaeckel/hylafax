<DD><I>Converting received facsimile with fax2ps generates warnings?</I>
<P>
Every time I receive a fax, I get this warning:
<LISTING>
    sdl:/var/spool/fax/recvq#> fax2ps fax029087 >x
    Fax3Decode1D: fax029087: Premature EOF at scanline 1056 (x 0).
    Fax3Decode1D: fax029087: Premature EOF at scanline 1056 (x 0).
    sdl:/var/spool/fax/recvq#> 
</LISTING>
    Is there something that I can do about this or is it on the sending end?
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>This problem is (was) on the receiving end; however the warnings
can be ignored.
<P>
Prior to the addition of copy quality checking in v2.3beta036,
the server code wrote the raw received fax data stream into
the file without properly parsing for end-of-line (EOL) and
return-to-control (RTC) codes.
As a result the recorded number of received lines in a facsimile page
was potentially too large if the raw data stream did not include
the 6 EOL codes that make up the RTC mark that
signals the end of a facsimile page.
The fax2ps program scans each page of data without regard for the
number of lines recorded in the TIFF file so it would sometimes
generate extraneous complaints.
