<H3>MACFLEX 1.0 BETA 2 AVAILABLE</H3>
<P>
There is a new version of MacFlex available.  It is available at:
<UL>
<A HREF="ftp://eats.com/pub/MacFlex-1-0-B2.sea.hqx">ftp://eats.com/pub/MacFlex-1-0-B2.sea.hqx</A>
</UL>
<P>
This version includes many fixes, most notably:
<OL>
<LI>the FAX number doesn't get munched using "print-to-fax"
<LI>seems to work with MS Word and MS Excel (wow!)
<LI>the FAX number isn't ignored when submitting manually (dumb, dumb, dumb)
<LI>better logging and status information (including the imaging process)
</OL>
<P>
On the downside, there's still a couple of things I haven't gotten to.  They
aren't essential for operation and use, but I do have them on my list.
<OL>
<LI>cover sheet support
<LI>ability to alter and remove jobs
<LI>a phone book
</OL>
<P>
In the future, I intend to take advantage of HylaFAX features.  Before the
official release, I probably will change the name and credits to reflect
HylaFAX, but the software should still work with FlexFAX for a while.  BTW,
I could use some ideas for a Macintosh/HylaFAX name combination (HylaMac
just doesn't sound all that great to me...)
<P>
There are some bugs I haven't been able to find, but they may have gone away
due to the other ones I fixed (please do not give me a programming lecture
just for hoping :-).  They are:
<P><OL>
<LI>crashes during the imaging process:<P>
     I haven't been able to make this part of the program crash.  If you 
     find a file that crashes the program -- PLEASE -- look in
<UL>
                "System Folder:MacFlex Folder:Print"
</UL>
     There should be a resource file there.  Send it to me if possible.
<P>
<LI>problems with preferences:<P>
     I am always able to change the preferences.  If someone still finds a
     problem, please send me some more info!
</OL>
<P>
Thanks to all the people who have used and tested it -- both for the
information you gave me, and for not being to angry when it screwed up :-).
<P>
Please give the new version a try!
<P>
