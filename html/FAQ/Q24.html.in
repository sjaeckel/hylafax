Also, how can I set up a config.ppi file to be automagically
selected correctly by faxaddmodem, for the Practical Peripherals
modems? I don't know enough shell script to untangle the
faxaddmodem awk and grep cleverness properly. And, in case it helps
to set it up, here are the +FMxx responses for these modems.
<LISTING>
Manufacturer=" (c) Practical Peripherals Inc., 1992, 1993."
Model="PM14400FXMT [6R1]"
</LISTING>

<DT>A.
<DD>If you look at another Class 2 modem config file you'll see a
comment of the form:
<LISTING>
# CONFIG: CLASS2: ZyXEL*-RTSTCTS
</LISTING>
The faxaddmodem script will grep for lines of this sort and select
one according to the modem type (CLASS1 or CLASS2) and DTE-DCE
flow control scheme.  The glob
pattern to the right of the CLASS2: is then massaged into a Bourne
shell case statement and applied to the string
<LISTING>
"$Manufacturer-$Model-$FlowControl"
</LISTING>
where $Manufacturer is the string returned by the modem in response
to a +FMFR? command, $Model is the string return for +FMDL?, and
$FlowControl is either RTSCTS or XONXOFF according to whether hardware
or software flow control is to be used.
Thus, the above example matches all modems manufactured by ZyXEL.
For your case, you can probably add a line like
<LISTING>
# CONFIG: CLASS2: *PM14400FXMT-XONXOFF
</LISTING>
though it would be good to come up with something that works for
all PPI modems that share the configuration.
