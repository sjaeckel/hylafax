On another note does one have to restart faxd in order for changes
in the modem configuration file to take effect?

<DD>No.  The HylaFAX servers will re-read a config file (if needed)
before each send and on any reset.  This means you only need to explicitly
restart a server if you change it before doing a receive.  You
can also avoid restarting it if you use cu/tip to talk to the modem
since this will cause the server to wakeup and then reset itself
when you exit from cu/tip.
