<DT>Q.
<DD><I>Problems compiling HylaFAX on SCO Unix?</I>
<P>
I'm having some problems compiling FlexFax on SCO Unix - in particular, I
don't seem to have a <B>netdb.h</B> file, which means <B>FaxClient.c++</B> and
<B>SendFaxClient.c++</B> won't compile. (This is with latest versions of SCO,
TCP/IP and the SCO dev sys with gcc 2.4.5).
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD><B>netdb.h</B> is part of the TCP/IP DevSys from SCO and include in the Open
Desktop Development System.  It is not part of the standard Unix
devsys.
<P>
I built flexfax-2.2 here with libg++-2.5.3 with no problems.  I
haven't tried the latest beta yet.
<P>
I have modified some of the system header files, and have patch files
necessary to create these available on
<A HREF="file://ftp.celestial.com/pub/sco-ports/unix">ftp.celestial.com</A>.
We also have flexfax-2.2 compiled there for SCO.
