<DD><I>What other HylaFAX software is available?</I>
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>HylaFAX is purely a command-line-based facsimile transport system;
much like mail transport packages such as sendmail and MMDF.  There
are several freely available packages that provide a front-end
to the HylaFAX software for sending facsimile and/or for monitoring
the HylaFAX send and receive queues:

A bit unrelated, but perhaps interesting,
is the "Remote Printing Experiment" being conducted by folks
on the Internet.  This provides a distributed fax delivery service that
uses email to relay facsimile to a local site for delivery.  For info
about that stuff send mail to
<A HREF="mailto:tpc-faq@town.hall.org">tpc-faq@town.hall.org</A> or
