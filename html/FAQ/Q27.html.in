<P>
I've found that the default font used by
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+textfmt">textfmt</A>
leaves a little
to be desired during the rendering process.  I realize that this is
more a ghostscript issue than a FlexFAX one, but I was wondering
what other users of FlexFAX have found.  [...] I tried using Type 1
fonts, rather than the bitmap ones supplied with ghostscript, and
they don't look any better.
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>If the problem is occurring on the faxes themselves, make sure that
the Fontmap entry for Ghostscript is really pointing to the Type 1
fonts.  (Try feeding "/Times-Roman findfont" (substitute whichever
font you're using for Times-Roman) to gs and verify that the path
from which it is loading the font is correct.)
<P>
If your observation is based on a preview using Ghostscript 2.6 or
later, try running gs with -dNOPLATFONTS (alternatively, you can add
"Ghostscript*UseExternalFonts: false" to your X resources if you're
previewing with X).
