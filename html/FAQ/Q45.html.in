</I>
<P>
I use an EverFax modem 24/96E that FlexFAX knows as a 24/96D.
Everything seems fine except a problem i find every time i have
to convert a received fax with 2D encoding to postscript using
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+fax2ps">fax2ps</A>.
No problems for the received 1D encoded faxes.
<P>
I always get the following errors:
<LISTING>
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 27 (x 5).
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 28 (x 5).
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 29 (x 5).
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 30 (x 5).
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 31 (x 5).

fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 33 (x 5).
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 34 (x 5).
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 35 (x 5).
fax000219: Fax3Decode1D: Bad code word at scanline 36 (x 5).
</LISTING>
and so on....
do you think it is *always* a problem of noisy line ?
Why do i have no problem with 1D encoded fax ?</I>

<DT>A.
<DD>Several people have reported problems with corrupted reception of
2D-encoded data.  At one point this worked fine with my Everex
24/96D, but it looks to be broken now.  You can workaround the
problem by disabling the reception of 2D-encoded data through
the <B>Class2DCCQueryCmd</B> configuration parameter; e.g.
<LISTING>
#
# +FDCC=? query syntax is:
#	(vr),(br),(wd),(ln),(df),(ec),(bf),(st)
# where,
#	vr	vertical resolution
#	br	bit rate
#	wd	page width
#	ln	page length
#	df	data compression
#	ec	error correction
#	bf	binary file transfer
#	st	scan time/line
#
Class2DCCQueryCmd:	"!(0,1),(0-3),(0-4),(0-2),(0),(0),(0),(0-7)"
</LISTING>
