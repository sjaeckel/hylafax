<DT>Q.
<DD><I>Why do my transmitted faxes appear squished at the receiver?</I>
<P>
I recently installed FlexFAX, Version 2.3beta on a Sparc IPC
using gcc 2.5.8.  I am using a Practical Peripherals PM14400FXMT
modem hanging off my ttyb serial port.
<P>
When I send faxes they are printed on the other end in about 
half the vertical space they should take up.
<P>
I see these entries in the log:
<LISTING>
Oct 23 14:44:05.42: [20266]: REMOTE best vres 7.7 line/mm
 ...
Oct 23 14:44:05.44: [20266]: USE 3.85 line/mm
</LISTING>
and this looks fishy to me.  I scanned a few back issues of the
archive for this mailing list and see the same thing in other logs,
but with no complaints of squashed faxes.
<P>
When I generate a tiff file and view it it does not appear to be
squashed.  So it isn't ghostscript to blame.
<P>
Any hints on what the problem could be?
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>This problem is caused by the modem firmware not properly
implementing the Class 2 specification.
Some modems are incapable of accepting an <TT>AT+FDIS</TT>
command to set the session parameters
between the time a call is placed and a page is transmitted.
Modems with this sort of problem may
ignore the <TT>AT+FDIS</TT> command which causes incorrect
session parameters being used to interpret the page data (often
resulting in ``<I>squished pages</I>''), or abort the session, returning
a <TT>+FHNG:</TT> status message to the host.
If you encounter this problem
use the <TT>Class2DDISCmd</TT> configuration
parameter to enable workaround support in the fax server
(<EM>this support was added in v2.3beta036.</EM>)
