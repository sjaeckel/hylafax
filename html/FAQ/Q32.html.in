</I><P>
I am wondering how to get fax to printed everytime I receive one.
Man pages say that changing the bin/faxrcvd script will do it. As it is
now, faxes are being saved in TIFF format (I think thats the default)
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>TIFF/Class F is the format in which HylaFAX stores received facsimile.
There is documentation on the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxrcvd">faxrcvd</A>
script invoked by the fax server for each received facsimile.
To print each received fax just modify the script according to
your local needs.  For example, you might use
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+fax2ps">fax2ps</A>
 (in the HylaFAX distribution) piped to ghostscript with the
Laserjet driver.
<PRE>
/usr/local/bin/fax2ps $1 | gs -q -sDEVICE=ljet3 -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=- | lp
</PRE>
<P>
Another useful program to use when printing TIFF images is the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+tiff2ps">tiff2ps</A> program
that is included in the
<A HREF="file://sgi.com/graphics/tiff/HOWTO">TIFF software distribution</A>.
