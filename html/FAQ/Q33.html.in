<DT>Q.
<DD><I>"No answer from remote" (extending the connect time)?</I>
<P>
I had a user attempt a fax to "01149364142xxxx" (Germany). It failed 
numerous times, with "no answer from remote". I dialled the number
myself, after 10-15 seconds, a modem answered, but without any rings 
first. Is this what is confusing my fax modem? S7 is 60 seconds. We
have successfully faxed to numerous places in Europe before.
<P>

<DD>That is not enough. It may take much longer for some connections
overseas to get established.
I'm using the following in the configuration file:
<LISTING>
ModemWaitTimeCmd:       S7=80           # Wait up to 80 seconds for a connect
</LISTING>
Consult
