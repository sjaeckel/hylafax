<P>
I have a SupraFAXModem with ROM version V1.400-03-CS29.  This is
connected to a Sun IPC running SunOS 4.1.2.  I'm trying to use
FlexFAX v2.3beta036 compiled with gcc 2.5.8 and libg++ 2.5.3.  I'm
using the standard config file for this modem type.  I didn't list
it here, but if people think it would be helpful, I could.
<P>
Everything else works ok (sending faxes, data connections in and
out).  Just receiving has a problem.  I've been trying to send from
a regular fax machine.  The fax machine complains that the remote
unit (my system) isn't responding and times out.  The log I get
is:

<DT>A.
<DD>You probably have the ModemRate set to other than 19.2.  Most Supra
modems lock the DTE-DCE speed to 19.2 when receiving in Class 2 (see
<A HREF="http://www.vix.com/flexfax/Modems/supra-v32bis.html">http://www.vix.com/flexfax/Modems/supra-v32bis.html</A>).  You can either
run at 19.2 all the time or try switching to 19.2 when a fax session
is initiated (see <B>ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd</B>).
