<DT>Q.
<DD><I> What is the current version/status of HylaFAX?</I>
<P>
<DT>A.
<DD>HylaFAX is distributed in two versions: a <I>released version</I>
    and a <I>beta version</I>.
<P>
Released versions represent software that has been carefully tested
on all supported platforms and is believed to compile, install, and
function correctly (except where noted in the distribution documentation).
Released versions take a long time to create.  The last few
released versions have been at least 6 months apart.
<P>
Beta versions are test versions of the software that are distributed
more frequently than released versions.  These versions include new
facilities and/or support for new systems.  They are typically tested
on one or two systems, but not as thoroughly as released versions and
not on all supported systems.
<P>
The current released and beta versions are always displayed on
the HylaFAX <A HREF="http://www.vix.com/hylafax/">home page</A>.
<P>
See also <A HREF="@HTMLPATH@/version.html">Q10</A>
for how to identify which version of HylaFAX you have.
