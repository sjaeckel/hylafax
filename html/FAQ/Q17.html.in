<P>
I noticed yesterday that the parameter order for sendfax can make a
difference in the cover sheet. If the "-x" is specified after the
"-d", the company name gets dropped from the cover sheet.
<LISTING>
sendfax -c"aaa" -r"bbb" -D -d"Greg Rowe@482-4001" -x"Metaphase" file
</LISTING>
Since I always put the -d last in the command line, I never noticed
it before.  Is this a known problem or do I have a problem with my
cover sheet?(It's the SGI one with my logo) I'm running the new
beta release on a SGI box.Thanks.

<IMG SRC="@HTMLPATH@/icons/smiley.gif" ALT=":-)">.  The -d flag causes a new
destination to be recorded using the current specifications for
company and location (the -x and -y options).  You can see this in
the code.  I'll see about clarifying this in the manual page.
