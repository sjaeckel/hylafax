HylaFAX is a facsimile system for UNIX systems.  It supports:

<UL>
<LI> sending facsimile
<LI> receiving facsimile
<LI> polled retrieval of facsimile
<LI> transparent shared data use of the modem
</UL>

Facsimile can be any size (e.g. A4, B4), either 98 or 196 lpi, and
transmitted/received as either 1D-encoded or 2D-encoded facsimile data
(2D-encoded data is frequently more compact and hence takes a shorter
time to communicate).  Any modem that supports one of the standard
interfaces for facsimile operation can be used; i.e. any
Class 1, Class 2, or Class 2.0 modem.

<P>
Outgoing documents can be any format; the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+sendfax">sendfax</A>
program uses a
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+typerules">rule-based definition file</A>
similar to the System V <B>/etc/magic</B> file 
to deduce document types and to decide how to convert each document
to a form suitable for transmission (either PostScript or TIFF/F).
Automatic cover page generation is supported and users can easily
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxcover">tailor cover pages</A>
to their environment.  A simple text-based
phonebook database is supported by <I>sendfax</I>.
Information is also
provided on how to trivially setup an
<A HREF="faxgateway.html">email to fax gateway</A> service.

<P>
Incoming facsimile are stored in a receiving area as TIFF/F (read
``<I>TIFF Class F</I>'') files and may be automatically delivered by mail
and/or printed.  A fax server status program,
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxstat">faxstat</A>,
can be used to monitor the send and receive queues,
as well as the state of facsimile servers.

<P>
Fax modems may be shared with outgoing data communication applications
that honor the "UUCP locking protocol".  These applications typically
include:
<I>cu</I>,
<I>tip</I>,
<I>kermit</I>,
<I>uucp</I>,
<I>slip</I>,
and
<I>ppp</I>.
The system can also be
configured so that incoming data calls cause the system to invoke the
standard system
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+getty">getty</A>
program.

<P>
The software is structured around a client-server architecture.
Fax modems may reside on a single machine on a network and
clients can submit an outbound job
from any machine that can communicate with
the machine on which the modems reside.  Client software is
designed to be lightweight and easy to port; imaging can be offloaded
to the server or done on the client.  (Imaging is, however, typically
done on the server because it simplifies administration.) 
An <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+hosts">access control</A>
mechanism is included to control which users on which machines may submit
jobs.

<P>
Multiple modems on a single server machine are effectively scheduled for
high throughput.  Broadcast faxing is well-supported through optimal
imaging of transmitted documents and the effective scheduling of
modem resources.
Support is provided for scheduling jobs during off-peak hours
based on the destination phone numbers (e.g. long distance calls
may be scheduled for off-peak phone rates).
An access control mechanism can be used to restrict the class of
phone numbers called so that, for example, calls to emergency
services such as 911 can be rejected out of hand.

<P>
The server requires a PostScript to facsimile imaging utility for
useful operation (otherwise, only pre-imaged facsimile may be
transmitted.)  A
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+ps2fax">Display PostScript-based imager</A>
is provided for IRIX 4.x- and 5.x-based systems.
For other systems,
<A HREF="ghostscript.html">a Ghostscript-based version</A>
can be built from the GNU sources.
