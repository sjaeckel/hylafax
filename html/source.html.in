The source distribution for HylaFAX contains <EM>all the code</EM>
in the system except a small bit
of code used to build the Display PostScript-based imager for
Silicon Graphics machines (this code is useless unless you have a
<STRONG>developers agreement</STRONG> with Adobe for
Display PostScript).

<P>
The system is written almost entirely in contemporary C++.
It uses nested types and in several places assumes the compiler 
generates code according to the ANSI C++ Reference Manual (ARM).
The normal development environment for the software
is based on compiler products from Silicon Graphics.
Every effort is made to insure the code builds correctly under
all contemporary C++ compilers, including the GNU gcc compiler
distribution.
Beware however that not all compilers will compile this software.

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALT="NOTE: " ALIGN=left HSPACE=8>
<EM>Versions of gcc prior to 2.6.1 will not correctly build this software;
gcc 2.6.3 and libg++ 2.6.2 are the current recommended versions
of the GNU tools to use</EM>.

<P>
To build this software your system must have the following
functionality or be capable of emulating those items that are missing:
<UL>
<LI>ANSI C compiler and runtime support (e.g.strftime).
<LI>C++ compiler and runtime support.  The C++ compiler must
  have support for nested types and ARM-style handling of temporary variables.
<LI>ANSI C system include files with proper function prototype declarations
  (though some missing function declarations will be automatically handled).
<LI>A make program that supports include files.
<LI>Support for BSD-style sockets and TCP/IP for network communication,
  including the select interface for synchronous multiplexing of I/O streams.
<LI>Support for FIFO special files.
<LI>Support for BSD-style file locking (flock) or equivalent functionality
  from which it can be emulated (fcntl, lockf).
<LI>POSIX 1003.1-style interfaces, including termios for manipulating
  tty devices.
</UL>

<P>
When the software is
<A HREF="building.html#Configure">configured for building</A>
any function that is not located will be emulated if it
is known how.
If a required facility is not found and no emulation or workaround
is known, then the configuration procedure will abort.

<P>
The Class 1 modem driver requires sub-second timer facilities and a
minimum latency interface to serial input.  The server uses the
BSD-style
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?2+setitimer">setitimer</A>
calls for the timer support and system-specific
calls to enable low latency input from serial ports.  If your system
does not support the BSD timer calls, then the server will fall back to
using the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?alarm">alarm</A>
system call that only has 1 second granularity (and the
driver is unlikely to work reliably).  If your system buffers serial
input and does not provide a mechanism for defeating this, then the
Class 1 driver will not work reliably.
See <A HREF="class1.html">the section above</A>
for specific requirements of the Class 1 support.

<P>
There is support in the fax server for handing inbound data calls 
to the system getty program.
This support must be
configured according to the requirements of the target platform;
either System V-style or BSD-style.
Only one of these two styles may be configured for use; the one that
is appropriate to the target system should automatically be selected when
the software is configured for building.

<P>
The system depends on the
<A HREF="file://sgi.com/graphics/interviews/FAQ">InterViews</A>
and
<A HREF="file://sgi.com/graphics/tiff/HOWTO">TIFF</A>
software distributions.  Only the
<EM>parts</EM> of each system that are used by this software are included
in the source distribution.  Both distributions in their entirety are freely
available by public FTP on the Internet.
