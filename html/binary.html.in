There are a number of pre-built binary distributions of the HylaFAX
source code that are blessed as <EM>safe for installation</EM>.
These distributions are available by public FTP from various
sites on the Internet.

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALT="NOTE: " ALIGN=left HSPACE=8 VSPACE=4>
<EM>Beware of taking binary distributions from sites that are not on this list.
HylaFAX includes several programs that are either started
by the super-user or are installed as setuid root; thus
installing untrusted distributions can be risky.</EM>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=center>

<P>
Many binary distributions are available on the master FTP site:

<PRE>
    <B>ftp.sgi.com</B>			<A HREF="file://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/fax/binary">sgi/fax/binary</A>
	(192.48.153.1)
</PRE>

These currently include:
<UL>
<LI>Silicon Graphics <I>inst'able images</I>
<LI>SVR4 <I>pkg images</I> for x86 systems
<LI>HPUX-9.01 for HP9000/7xx systems
<LI>Ultrix 4.4 for DecStation-5000 systems
<LI>SunOS 4.1.x for Sparc
</UL>

[<I>This list may be out of date, check the FTP directory.</I>]

<P>
Alternate sites that either mirror the master FTP site or that have
specific binary distributions are:

<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALT="NOTE: " ALIGN=left HSPACE=8>
<I>These sites had binary distributions of FlexFAX, they will
presumably have HylaFAX distributions soon.</I>

<P>
SCO binary distributions are available from:
<PRE>
    <B>ftp.celestial.com</B>		<A HREF="file://ftp.celestial.com/pub/sco-ports/unix">/pub/sco-ports/unix</A>
	(192.136.111.2)
</PRE>

<P>
FreeBSD binary distributions are available from:
<PRE>
    <B>freebsd.cdrom.com</B>		<A HREF="file://freebsd.cdrom.com/pub/FreeBSD/packages/">/pub/FreeBSD/packages</A>
	(192.216.191.11)
</PRE>

<P>
NetBSD binary distributions are available from:
<PRE>
    <B>ftp.netbsd.org</B>		<A HREF="file://ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/binaries/NetBSD-1.0/i386">/pub/NetBSD/packages/binaries/NetBSD-1.0/i386</A>

<P>
The binary distributions come with their own instructions because
their format varies.  The following guidelines describe
how to interpret the filenames to understand the
format and contents of each distribution.

<P>
Distribution filenames are of the form:
<TT>hylafax-</TT>&lt;<I>target</I>&gt;-&lt;<I>version</I>&gt;-&lt;<I>format</I>&gt;;
where &lt;<I>target</I>&gt; describes the target system,
&lt;<I>version</I>&gt; specifies the HylaFAX version the distribution
was built from, and &lt;<I>format</I>&gt; specifies the format of
the distribution as follows:
<UL>
<LI>a <TT>.Z</TT> suffix indicates the file has been compressed with the
    <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+compress">compress(1)</A> program
<LI>a <TT>.gz</TT> suffix indicates the file has been compressed with the
    <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+gzip">GNU gzip(1)</A> program
<LI>a <TT>.tar</TT> component indicates the file was created with the
    <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+tar">tar(1)</A> program
<LI>a <TT>-inst</TT> component indicates the file contains images for the IRIX
    <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+inst">inst(1)</A> program
<LI>a <TT>-pkg</TT> component indicates the file contains images for the SVR4
    <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+pkgadd">pkgadd(1M)</A> program
</UL>

<P>
So, for example, <TT>hylafax-irix5-v3.0beta099-inst.tar</TT> is
a binary distribution for machines running IRIX 5.x and the 
distribution is provided as IRIX inst images collected together in a
single archive created by the tar program.

<P>
In addition to the binary distributions, there may also be two other
files present for each target system.
Files of the form <TT>INSTALL-*-*</TT> are
installation instructions for a specific binary distribution.
Files of the form <TT>gs*-*-tar.gz</TT>
are binary distributions of Ghostscript, the Ghostscript fonts, and
any associated .ps files; configured for use with HylaFAX.
