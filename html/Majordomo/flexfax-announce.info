This is a mailing list for *announcments* about the freely available
FlexFAX fax software.  There is also the mailing list

    flexfax@sgi.sgi.com

where users discuss problems with the FlexFAX software.  Messages posted
to this announcment list are automatically cross-posted to the flexfax
mailing list so there is no need to subscribe to both lists.

All messages sent to this list are reviewed by a moderator before being
forwarded to members of the list.

Bounced email is treated very aggressively on this list.  If email to you
bounces for more than 24 hours, you'll probably be moved from this list
to a "bounces" list, where you'll get a message daily telling you what's
happened and how to get back on to this list.
