<A NAME="ClientBasics"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>LIENT BASICS</B></A>

<P>
There are several components to the complete HylaFAX software package:
<UL>
<LI>client applications
(<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+sendfax">sendfax</A>,
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxstat">faxstat</A>,
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxrm">faxrm</A>, etc.),
<LI>the job submission and server status process that runs
on the server machine and communicates with client applictions
(<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxd.recv">faxd.recv</A>),
<LI>the facsimile server processes that
service each modem
(<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxgetty">faxgetty</A>), and
<LI>the central scheduler for outbound jobs
(<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxq">faxq</A>).
</UL>

If you are having trouble first try to identify
which component is failing.
All client applications support a
<TT>-v</TT>
option to enable various levels of debugging.  It is possible with one
or more
<TT>-v</TT>
options to trace the protocol between the application and
the faxd.recv process on the server machine. 
faxd.recv has a
<TT>-d</TT>
option that enables tracing of the protocol it receives and its general
operation.  If you are in doubt about where a problem lies, try the
following:

<P>
Run faxstat to request server status.  You should see something like:

<UL><PRE><TT>
Server on localhost:FIFO for all modems: Running.
Server on localhost:ttym2 for "+1 510 526-8781": Initializing server.
</TT></PRE></UL>

or possibly,

<UL><PRE><TT>
Server on localhost:FIFO for all modems: Not running.
</TT></PRE></UL>

If you do not see something like this, then you are having problems
communicating with the faxd.recv program on the server machine or
there is a configuration problem on the server machine.  If you cannot
establish a connection to the faxd.recv process on the server machine,
then verify that you have your <TT>FAXSERVER</TT> environment variable setup
correctly (if the server is not on the machine where the faxstat program
is run) and/or that both client and server programs are communicating
on the same TCP port.  On the server machine make sure that the faxd.recv
program is properly configured to be invoked by the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+inetd">inetd</A>
program; check
the contents of
<A HREF="file:/etc/inetd.conf"><B>/etc/inetd.conf</B></A>,
or similar, for a line of the form:

<UL><PRE><TT>
fax	stream	tcp	nowait	fax	/usr/etc/faxd.recv	faxd.recv
</TT></PRE></UL>

<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=4>
<EM>Be certain that
<I>inetd</I> has ``<I>reread</I>'' its configuration file; either send
it a SIGHUP or restart it.  This work should automatically be done
when the faxaddmodem program is run on the server machine.</EM>

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=4>
<EM>Note also
that the <TT>fax</TT> service must be defined on the server machine in order
for inetd
to startup the faxd.recv program--check for this entry in the
<A HREF="file:/etc/services"><B>/etc/services</B></A> file and/or the YP/NIS
database.</EM>

<P>
As a last resort, you
can always use an existing network service such as
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+telnet">telnet</A> to communicate
with the faxd.recv process;

<UL><PRE><TT>
hyla% <B>telnet localhost fax</B>
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.asd.sgi.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
<B>help</B>
error:Protocol botch, malformed line "help".
Connection closed by foreign host.
</TT></PRE></UL>

[<EM>Ed: Ignore the protocol botch, this is just to show you that
 you can reach faxd.recv using telnet.</EM>]

<P>
If the network-related configuration is setup properly but faxstat
still does not return one of the above lines; use the <TT>-v</TT> option to
trace the client-server protocol:

<UL><PRE><TT>
hyla% <B>faxstat -v</B>
connect to oxford.chez (155.11.194.2) at port 4557
-> version:2
-> userID:sam
-> serverStatus:
-> userStatus:Sam Leffler
-> .
<- server:all modems:FIFO:Running
<- server:"+1 510 526-8781":ttym2:Running and idle
<- EOF
Server on oxford.chez:FIFO for all modems: Running.
Server on oxford.chez:ttym2 for "+1 510 526-8781": Running and idle.
</TT></PRE></UL>

A protocol and/or configuration problem should be evident from the 
trace information.  You can also configure faxd.recv
to log its operation
through
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?3+syslog">syslog</A>
by supply a <TT>-d</TT> option in the
<B>inetd.conf</B> file:

<UL><PRE><TT>
fax	stream	tcp	nowait	fax	/usr/local/sbin/faxd.recv	faxd.recv -d
</TT></PRE></UL>

Once again, remember that inetd
will not see a change to the <B>inetd.conf</B>
file until it is restarted or sent a SIGHUP; and
that faxd.recv logs
its debugging information through
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?3+syslog">syslog</A>
(using the syslog facility setup when the
configure script was run to configure the HylaFAX software).

<A NAME="ClientAccess"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>LIENT ACCESS CONTROL PROBLEMS</B></A>

<P>
Given a working client-server setup, problems that you encounter are
either server-related or related to misconfigured permissions on the
server machine.  The faxd.recv
program will process any client requests
that do not create a new outbound job, alter an existing job's
parameters, or remove a job from the queue.  To do one of these
<I>privileged</I> operations, a client must have access according to the
<B>etc/hosts</B> file located in the spooling are on the server machine.
Consult the manual page
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+hosts">hosts(4F)</A> for details on this file.
Otherwise the only thing to beware of is that faxd.recv is started by
inetd with the correct user ID; otherwise protected directories in the
spooling area may not be accessible.

<A NAME="ServerBasics"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ERVER BASICS</B></A>

<P>
One faxq process manages the scheduling and initiation of all outbound
traffic; it carries out many tasks:

<UL>
<LI>
manage the queue of outbound jobs
<LI>
prepare PostScript documents for transmission
<LI>
start the processes that do the low-level work to transmit facsimile
</UL>

One faxgetty server process is usually run for each fax
modem on a machine.
These processes are responsible for handling inbound traffic;
they also carry out many tasks:

<UL>
<LI>
answer incoming calls and decide whether the call is fax or data
<LI>
do the low-level work to receive facsimile
<LI>
invoke the system getty program to handle data calls
</UL>

Proper setup of HylaFAX involves setting up the modem configuration
files and the ancillary programs and command scripts that are invoked
by faxq and by faxgetty.  The setup of the ancillary
programs should automatically be done when the software is configured
and installed.
The modem-related setup and much of the system-related configuration
work should be done when the faxaddmodem command is used to create a
modem configuration file.  Problems that arise in the normal operation
of a server typically fall into two categories:

<UL>
<LI>incorrect configuration and/or setup of the server software,
<LI>incorrect configuration of the modem. 
</UL>

In either case HylaFAX provides extensive tracing facilities
that should supply the information needed to locate and correct a problem.

<P>
With regard to the first problem, remember that faxq will only schedule
an outbound job for modems that it knows about.  This information is
received either from a faxgetty process or by a modem specified on the
command line when faxq is started.  If faxq does not know about a modem
through one of these mechanisms or if a job is submitted for a modem
that is not known to faxq then the job will not be scheduled.  Note that
the latter is problematic because faxq cannot know a priori that a requested
modem does not exist--the modem may simply ``not yet be ready''.

<P>
The tracing controls are completely described in the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+config">config(4F)</A> manual page.
faxq tracing information is controlled by two configuration
parameters specified in the file <B>etc/config</B> in the spooling
area:  <B>ServerTracing</B> and <B>LogFacility</B>.
The <B>ServerTracing</B>
parameter controls which work faxq should trace.
<B>LogFacility</B> specifies the 
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?3+syslog">syslog(3)</A>
facility where the tracing messages should be directed.
By default server tracing information is directed to the
``<TT>daemon</TT>'' facility.

<P>
To capture server tracing you must enable the appropriate
bits in the <B>ServerTracing</B> parameter and configure
the <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+syslogd">syslogd</A> process
to capture
<TT>daemon.info</TT>,
<TT>daemon.debug</TT>, and
<TT>daemon.err</TT>;
or substitute for <TT>daemon</TT> to reflect the value of the
<B>LogFacility</B> parameter.
Note that by setting <B>LogFacility</B> to something like <TT>local5</TT>
it is easy to capture HylaFAX syslog messages in a separate file; just
setup the <B>syslog.conf</B> file appropriately, e.g.
<UL><PRE><TT>
local5.*            /var/spool/fax/etc/syslog
</TT></PRE></UL>

<P>
A sample server trace log is shown below.
The lines marked ``<TT>FaxQueuer</TT>'' are generated by the faxq
process.
The lines marked ``<TT>FaxGetty</TT>'' are generated by a faxgetty process.
The process ID of each process is shown enclosed in ``[]''.
Each line is marked with the date and time that it was generated.

<P>
The <B>SessionTracing</B> parameter controls tracing information
<EM>during the
time HylaFAX is engaged in conversation with another device</EM> (fax
machine, pager service provider, etc.)
Tracing of this sort is done by faxgetty processes (when receiving
facsimile) and by processes
started up by faxq to process outbound jobs (faxsend, pagesend, etc.).
Session tracing is controlled by configuration parameters
specified in the per-modem configuration files.
It is also possible to enable session tracing on a per-destination basis
for outbound jobs through the <B>DestControls</B> facility.

<P>
Communication-related problems will be found in the
information logged under session tracing.
Session tracing information is stored in files in the
<B>log</B> subdirectory in the spooling tree and is returned to users via
electronic mail when notification is requested, or when an
unrecoverable error is encountered.  Consult
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+log">log(4F)</A> for more information.

<P>
A sample snippet from a session log is shown below.
The trace was collected from a transmission that used a Class 1 modem.
The <B>SessionTracing</B> parameter was set at <TT>0x4f</TT>.
Note that the format is very similar to the information collected
through syslog (as shown above).
Beware that since HylaFAX supports multiple modems on a single
machine, multiple
calls to the same destination may be going on simultaneously and
the session log files may have messages from multiple calls interspersed.

<P>
Messages sent <EM>to the modem</EM> are identified by a ``<TT>&lt;--</TT>''
mark while data received <EM>from the modem</EM> are identified by a
``<TT>--&gt;</TT>''.
Timestamps show the date and time, with time to the right of the
decimal point displayed to 10 millisecond precision (the typical
granularity of the realtime clock on a UNIX system).

<A NAME="Queue"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT>UEUE MANAGEMENT</B></A>

<P>
There is very little that can go wrong with the server with respect to
managing the queue of outbound jobs. 
Setting the system time backwards
on the server machine can cause problems as timers managed by faxq
are calculated relative to the current time-of-day.
Jobs may be rejected
without a phone call if a <B>rejectNotice</B> entry is present for a
destination phone number in the
destination controls file
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+destctrls">destctrls(4F)</A>.
Beware that multiple jobs to the same destination are usually
serialized to reduce phone calls.
Jobs that are blocked in this way have a
"<I>Blocked by concurrent...</I>" status.
You can change the maximum number
of concurrent jobs that will be scheduled to a destination with the
<B>MaxConcurrentJobs</B> configuration parameter.

<P>
Otherwise if a problem exists enable the queue management bit in the
<B>ServerTracing</B> parameter for the faxq process; e.g.

<UL><PRE><TT>
ServerTracing:	0x201
</TT></PRE></UL>

There is also a separate bit for tracing low-level job queue operations;
this should not be needed.

<A NAME="PSPrep"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>OSTSCRIPT DOCUMENT PREPARATION</B></A>

<P>
When debugging problems related to the preparation of PostScript
documents, collect the appropriate command line arguments to the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+ps2fax">ps2fax(1M)</A>
program from the syslog trace messages
and invoke it directly on an offending document.
Beware, however, that if the fax server is started up by the
<A HREf="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+init">init(1M)</A>
program that it may inherit a different shell environment.  In
particular, beware of problems with search paths when the PostScript
interpreter program is linked with Dynamic Shared Objects (DSO's);
e.g. when Ghostscript is linked with the the X11 driver and a
DSO version of the X library.

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALT="NOTE: " ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<EM>
On machines with dynamic shared libraries (e.g. SunOS), if you
link Ghostscript with the X11 device driver and use shared X11
libraries that are not in a standard location, then you may need to
augment the HylaFAX
<B>util/ps2fax.gs.sh</B> script with something of the form:
</EM>
<PRE>
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/R5/lib:/usr/openwin/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</PRE>

<A NAME="CommProblems"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>OMMUNICATION PROBLEMS</B></A>

<P>
If a problem occurs during faxgetty initialization, set
<B>ServerTracing</B> to 11, or similar, in the modem
configuration file and check the syslog trace messages.
Modem initialization for an outbound job is included in the
session log and controlled by the <B>SessionTracing</B> parameter.
Problems during modem setup are typically caused by:

<UL>
<LI>misconfiguration of the flow control scheme,
<LI>not disabling the getty program
on the modem port (so that multiple processes
are simultaneously trying to read/write to the modem), and
<LI>invalid initialization sequences.
</UL>

<P>
Normal installation of HylaFAX will enable sufficient session
tracing to debug session communication problems.  Unexpected problems
may require you to alter the value of the
<B>SessionTracing</B> parameter. 

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=4>
<EM>When debugging modem-related problems, only
enable the tracing that you really need.  Enabling all tracing can
affect the operation of the server processes by altering the timing of
operations</EM>.

<P>
The default configuration files come with
<B>SessionTracing</B>
set to 11 which is a good setting for Class 2 modems (i.e. a lot of
information is provided, but the load on the server should not keep it
from operating properly).  For Class 1 modems a setting of 0x4f will
also cause HDLC frames to be collected.
Beware of tracing timer
operations and modem I/O; these trace flags are only useful if you are
trying to debug a problem specifically related to a timer not going
off, or a problem where data appears to be corrupted.

<P>
Note that when capturing a trace for the purpose of submitting a bug
report, the less extraneous information that you include, the easier it
is for people to help understand the problem.
Most of the time HylaFAX will return the relevant session log for
a communication failure in the notification message sent to a user
when an outbound job fails.  Note however that the contents of
this log is controlled by the value of the <B>SessionTracing</B>
parameter specified in the per-modem configuration files.
If this parameter is set too low then session logs may be returned
that do not show sufficient information to diagnose a problem.

<P>
The <A HREF="FAQ/index.html#Trouble">HylaFAQ</A> contains
information on some common communication problems
that might be encountered.
It is also important to monitor the operation of a server to detect
trends that might indicate modem or telecommunication problems;
the <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+faxcron">faxcron(1M)</A>
script is useful for doing this since it extracts
the transcripts of failed calls.


<A NAME="GettyProblems"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>ETTY PROBLEMS</B></A>

<P>
HylaFAX will invoke the getty program when a data connection is
established and the <TT>GettyArgs</TT> parameter is set to a non-null string.
When HylaFAX
starts up a getty program it sets the standard input, output, and error
descriptors to the modem device (closing all other descriptors),
creates a new process group, and turns off the <TT>CLOCAL</TT>
bit on the tty device so that if carrier is dropped the process group
will receive a SIGHUP signal.

<UL>
<LI>Be sure that the system is not also configured to start getty
on the modem's tty port. 
<LI>Beware of misconfigured getty arguments that cause getty
to reopen and/or initialize the modem device.
<LI>Also be
careful that on some systems the
<B>/etc/ttytab</B>
entry for the modem port must be setup as a
<I>dialup</I> line as opposed to a <I>local</I> line.
</UL>

The <A HREF="FAQ/">HylaFAQ</A> has information about other system-specific
problems that you may encounter.

<A NAME="Locking"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ROUBLESHOOTING: <FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>ROBLEMS WITH UUCP, CU, TIP, ETC.</B></A>

<P>
If you have a problem running the fax software together with other
communication programs such as uucp, cu, tip, slip, ppp, etc. first
verify that your data communication
software is configured to use the correct modem
initialization strings.  In particular, beware that most of the
prototype modem configuration files for the fax server will leave the
modem ``<I>idling</I>'' in Class 1, Class 2, or Class 2.0.
This means that in order to place a data call
the modem must first be reset to Class 0.  Other
common problems involve the ownership and protection of the modem
devices.  When the fax server is running it forces the tty device to be
owned by the ``fax'' user
(typically the same UID as the ``uucp'' user)
and to have the mode specified by the
<B>DeviceMode</B> configuration parameter.
Finally, beware that there are several different styles of UUCP
lock files; verify that your UUCP and related programs
use the same style that HylaFAX is configured to use.
The UUCP lock file scheme used by HylaFAX may be specified with
the <B>UUCPLockType</B> configuration parameter.
If you specify this parameter be certain to put it in both the
faxq configuration file and each modem configuration file; otherwise
one HylaFAX server process may do the right thing while another may not.
