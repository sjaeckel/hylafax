HylaFAX is based on a client-server architecture.  A
single fax server machine with one or more fax modems may service a
network of client machines that do not have fax modems.  
Client and server machines typically communicate using a
special HylaFAX client-server protocol that is transported on top of
the TCP/IP protocols.
Alternatively, clients can be setup to submit facsimile using
other transport mechanisms such as electronic mail or a network
printing service.
This chapter discusses only the setup of a UNIX system as a
client machine that uses the standard HylaFAX client applications
to submit and manage outbound facsimile jobs.
Building a mail-to-fax gateway is discussed in a separate
<A HREF="faxgateway.html">chapter</A>.
You are on your own if you want to use a printer protocol
to hook clients
up; though it is not much more complicated than the mail route
(you should look at how the mail support is done).

<P><A NAME="IRIX"><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H2>From the IRIX Binary Distribution</H2></A>

When installing HylaFAX from the IRIX binary distribution format, client
machines can be setup simply by installing the <TT>hylafax.*.client</TT>
images:

<UL><PRE><TT>
hyla# inst -f dist/hylafax		# must be done as super-user
...
inst> install hylafax.*.client
inst> go
</TT></PRE></UL>

(actually, the default packages to install should be the ones needed to
setup a client machine).
If you do not have the font metric files installed on the client
(they are part of the <B>dps_fonts</B> image) you will also want to
install <TT>hylafax.sw.afm</TT>.

<P><A NAME="Source"><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H2>From the Source Distribution</H2></A>

From the source distribution configure and build the software 
as described in 
<A HREF="building.html">Building HylaFAX From Source Code</A>
(NB: this will build both client and server software).
To install only the programs and files required on a client then do

<UL><PRE><TT>
hyla# make installClient
</TT></PRE></UL>

The set of files required for a HylaFAX client is specified in the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?1+hylafax">hylafax(1)</A>
manual page (see the FILES section).

<P><A NAME="Service"><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H2>Setting up the ``fax'' Service</H2></A>

With the applications and data files available on a client machine,
the only other task to perform on the client machine
is to setup an entry in the
<B>/etc/services</B> file or equivalent YP/NIS database for
the ``fax'' service.
This work is automatically done on the server machine by the faxaddmodem
script using a line of the form:

<UL><PRE><TT>
fax     4557/tcp                # FAX transmission service
</TT></PRE></UL>

On the client machine however you will want to set this up by hand
unless the the system is configured to use YP/NIS and the fax service
is registered globally through YP/NIS.
Note that if no service entry exists for the ``fax'' service then a
default builtin port number is used.  If the HylaFAX client-server
software is configured to communicate on a port other than the
default port, then the server must be registered.

<P><A NAME="Access"><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H2>Setting up Server Access</H2></A>

Once a client machine is setup for use the server machine may need to
be configured to permit jobs to be submitted.  Specifically, the file
<B>etc/hosts</B> in the spooling area on the server machine must be setup to
permit each client machine access.
Consult the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?4+hosts">hosts(4F)</A> manual page
for information on how this is done.
