#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class1		# use this to supply a hint

#
#             *** Caller-ID settings ***
#
# Enabling this will use the hfaxd-protocol to set Caller*ID
#
#ModemSetOriginCmd:	"AT+VSID=\"%s\",\"%d\""
#
# If "glare" during initialization becomes a problem then take
# the modem off-hook during initialization, and then place it
# back on-hook when done.
#
#ModemResetCmds:	"ATH1\nAT+VCID=1"	# enables CallID display
#ModemReadyCmds:	ATH0
#
# However, glare is mostly avoided by iaxmodem's 5-second internal
# busy-out that occurs after hangups and resets.  These two settings
# will help ensure that our reset and initialization periods don't 
# go beyond that 5-second period.
#
ModemResetDelay: 0				# DTR isn't handled, anyway
ModemSoftResetCmdDelay: 0			# modem reset is complete at "OK"

#
# You'll likely want Caller*ID display (also displays DID) enabled.
#
ModemResetCmds:		AT+VCID=1	# enables CallID display
#
# If you are "missing" Caller*ID data on some calls (but not all)
# and if you do not have adequate glare protection you may want to
# not answer based on RINGs, but rather enable the CallIDAnswerLength
# for NDID, disable AT+VCID=1 and do this:
#
#RingsBeforeAnswer: 0
#ModemRingResponse: AT+VRID=1

# The pty apparently does not support changing parity.
PagerTTYParity:		none

Class1AdaptRecvCmd:	AT+FAR=1
Class1TMConnectDelay:	400		# counteract quick CONNECT response

#
# Older iaxmodem versions didn't support V.17 very well.  It can be
# disabled in this fashion:
#
#Class1RMQueryCmd:	"!24,48,72,96"	# V.17 fast-train recv doesn't work well
#Class1TMQueryCmd:	"!24,48,72,96"	# V.17 fast-train recv doesn't work well
