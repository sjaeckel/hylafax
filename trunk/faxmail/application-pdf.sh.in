# Historically the pswrite device was used.  There were some
# reports that indicated that ps2write output looked better,
# and so for a time ps2write was used as a default, instead, 
# but apparently some Ghostscript releases had buggy ps2write 
# devices, and so we reverted to pswrite as a default.
# Ultimately Ghostscript abandoned and removed the pswrite 
# device entirely.  So we are obliged to use ps2write when
# the pswrite device is missing.  However, users who have 
# pswrite available to them may still want to evaluate 
# whether or not the ps2write device will produce better 
# output for them.
