If this file proves to be insufficient, please read the included
man pages and see on-line documentation at:

    http://hylafax.sourceforge.net/

The online documentation includes the man pages as well as an HOWTO
and other resources.

Installation Synopsis
---------------------
The documentation is extensive and designed to be used when installing
the software.

The basic procedure is:

    <unpack source code>
    % ./configure
    % make
    % su			# NB: must be root to setup software
    # make install
    # faxsetup

If this does not work and the problem is not clear, then you will
need to look at the documentation and/or the code.

There is documentation!  There is GOBS of documentation.  The on-line
materials present information needed to build+setup the software; the
manual pages act as a reference guide.  There are manual pages for all
the programs and for all the files and directories that you may be
curious about.  Of course there is also source code for everything, but
this should (hopefully) not be needed.  A useful introduction to the
client applications is given in the hylafax-client manpage.  If you want 
to learn how the server and spooling system work, look first at the 
hylafax-server manpage.  Remember however that the manual pages are for 
reference; the on-line documentation is designed to be more introductory in 
nature and should usually be consulted first when you're looking for 
general guidance.
