# You'll likely want Caller*ID display (also displays DID) enabled.

ModemResetCmds:		AT+VCID=1	# enables CallID display
#
# If you are "missing" Caller*ID data on some calls (but not all)
# and if you do not have adequate glare protection you may want to
# not answer based on RINGs, but rather enable the CallIDAnswerLength
# for NDID, disable AT+VCID=1 and do this:

#RingsBeforeAnswer: 0
#ModemRingResponse: AT+VRID=1
