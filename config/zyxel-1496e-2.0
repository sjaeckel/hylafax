# Configuration for a ZyXEL-1496E w/ Class 2.0 firmware.
# Firmware revisions from 6.12 on should work.
#
# This configuration file sets up the ZyXEL to run at 38.4 for
# both sending and receiving.  RTS/CTS flow control is used on
# the tty port--you probably shouldn't use XON/XOFF.  Note that
# on an SGI system the getty speed is the following non-standard
# gettydefs entry:
#
# dx_38400# B38400 # B38400 SANE TAB3 HUPCL #\r\n\n$HOSTNAME login: #dx_38400
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2.0: ZyXEL*-RTSCTS
# CONFIG: CLASS2.0: ZyXEL*-DEFAULT
#
# BEGIN-SERVER
# END-SERVER
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
