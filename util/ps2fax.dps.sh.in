# files so that we can prepend a prologue file that defines
# LaserWriter-specific stuff as well as to insert and error
# handler that generates ASCII diagnostic messages when
# a problem is encountered in the interpreter.

# NB: this shell script is assumed to be run from the
#     top of the spooling hierarchy -- s.t. the etc directory
