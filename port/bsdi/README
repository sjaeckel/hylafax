BSD/386 1.1 info:

   ->	You will need GNU make, since BSD make does not support the SV-style
	Makefiles (with "include" and "sinclude" primitives).

   ->	Your kernel has to have been built with the FIFO option.  (most are.)

   ->	This version will install over the top of the BSDi-supplied FlexFax.
	In particular, it depends on /usr/contrib/lib/flexfax/afm already
	having the Adobe Font Metric files in it.  You can get these by
	installing the entire FlexFax package from the BSD/386 distribution
	media BEFORE you build this (later) version of FlexFax and install it.

   ->	This version uses LOG_LOCAL5 for its logging; you can take advantage
	of this by putting
		local5.debug					/var/log/fax
	into your /etc/syslog.conf, touching /var/log/fax, and SIGHUP'ing your
	syslogd.  You will then get fax-specific logging in a separate file
	instead of having to grovel /var/log/messages for it.  IF YOU DO NOT
	WANT TO DO THIS YOU WILL HAVE TO EDIT THE defs FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY
	BEFORE YOU BUILD FLEXFAX.

   ->	This version connects to itself via your primary interface rather than
	through your loopback interface; the default host list in
	/var/spool/flexfax/etc/hosts contains only the latter, so you will
	need to add the former.  (Sendfax will tell you.)

   ->	After you "gnumake install" this version of FlexFax for the first time
	on a BSD/386 1.1 system, you will have to delete the old formatted man
	pages that were installed from the BSD/386 1.1 distribution media.  To
	do this:

		cd /usr/contrib/man/cat1
		rm fax2ps.0 faxalter.0 faxcover.0 faxmail.0
		rm faxrm.0 faxstat.0 sendfax.0 textfmt.0
		cd /usr/contrib/man/cat8
		rm dialtest.0 faxaddmodem.0 faxanswer.0
		rm faxd.0 faxd.recv.0 faxquit.0

	(thanks are due RD Thrush <rd@tarpit.oau.org> for that suggestion.)

   ->	To make a faxmodem work for incoming data as well, you can try making
	a "bidir.38400-hf" entry in /etc/gettytab and then referring to that
	in your rc.local startup lines, i.e.,

		/usr/libexec/faxd -g bidir.38400-hf -m /dev/tty00
		                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
=============================================================================

BSD/386 1.0 info: (note: it is recommended that you simply upgrade to BSD/386
1.1 and follow the above recommendations.)

From: @natinst.com:fubar!dap (Damon Permezel)

These comments pertain to version 1.0 of BSDi.

You will need to obtain the following from your local source archive site:
	gcc 2.3.3 or later, and a compatible libg++
	GNU make
	ghostscript 2.5.2 or later (2.5.2 is provided in 1.0)

First step is to obtain the above, compile and install.
See gs/README for instructions on how to add the "tiffhigh" and "tifflow"
devices to Ghostscript.

Next, you will have to modify your kernel configuration, to add the following:

	options	FIFO

The "FIFO" option causes support for named pipes in the filesystem.
Without "FIFO" being enabled, FlexFax will not function.

Rebuild your kernel (see "Rebuilding Your Kernel" on page 38 of the Revision
1.0 release notes) and reboot from the new version.

cd to the FlexFax source directory.

Run ./configure.

Make sure that all the paths, etc, are correct, and that the UUCP lock
type is binary.

as root, running bash, issue:

	# ulimit -s unlimited
	# ulimit -m unlimited
	# ulimit -d unlimited
	# gmake

The `ulimit's are necessary to compile libtiff/tif_fax3.c, since it includes
the libtiff/g3states.h include file, which is humungous.

faxaddmodem requires /bin/bash, rather than sh.  To invoke it, use

	# bash ./faxaddmodem.sh -os BSDi -s 38400


I run FlexFax with a ZyXEL internal modem, running UUCP on the
same port as faxes.  The GettyBSD.c++ file enables this, by exec()ing
/usr/libexec/getty when a data call comes in.
I run getty at a fixed rate of 38400, using the "hw.38400" entry in the
gettytab.

hw.38400:\
	:to=30:tc=38400-baud:

Prior to invoking login, getty resets the port to the "default" setting.
I run the modem in a manner which requires "clocal" be turned on in order
to talk to it.  Faxd turns on "clocal".  When login runs, I want "clocal"
off.  Thus, the "default" settings for the modem are set so that "clocal"
is turned of.  This causes SIGHUP to be sent to the session when the
modem drops carrier.

I have the following in /etc/rc.local to setup the "default" settings.

stty -f /dev/tty02 -D cts_oflow rts_iflow 38400 cs8 -parenb -istrip -clocal


Problems:
	ZyXEL modem is buggy.  Fax reception often renders garbage.
