$Header: /usr/people/sam/fax/port/4.4bsd/RCS/README,v 1.1 1993/05/11 10:45:10 sam Exp $

This directory includes the stuff needed to build under the latest 4.4BSD
code running at CSRG.  When building beware that you may run out of virtual
memory when compiling libtiff/tif_fax3.c.  If this happens, you'll either
have to patch your compiler with ../port/GCC-PATCH to reduce the amount of
memory used when compiling intialized data structures or rebuild the kernel
for more virtual memory, as described in in ../bsdi/README.  In either case
you're likely to need to set your resource limits to be unlimited--check
out ../bsdi/README for more explicit instructions.
