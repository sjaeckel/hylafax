Stuff to make sure you check:
  - all configurable pathnames (my setup is pretty bizarre)
  - either define _G_SYSV in your g++-include/_G_config.h or in ./defs CVERSION
    make sure gas and/or ld can be reached under the dir specified by -B
    (trailing slash  i s  significant) in ./defs CVERSION
    (they  m u s t  be named as / ld)
  - use gnu awk for xferstarts
  - in case you use faxmail via mailfax/sendmail you might want to add
    FAX to your fake domains (besides the other changes mentioned in
    mailfax.sh-sendmail) to avoid asking the nameserver for these 'addresses'
  - you'll need the gnu version of grep
  - PATHS in configure and faxaddmodem scripts. You might even want to use
    bash.
  - you might want to modify your g++-include/sys/socket.h
    (change the void* to fd_set*) to:
    int      select _G_ARGS((int, fd_set*, fd_set*, fd_set*, struct timeval*));
Other random notes:
  - my OS is ISC 4.0; your mileage may vary
  - gcc is 2.5.8, libg++ is 2.5.3, gas is 2.2, ld is from binutils-2.3
  - I didn't try the asy(7) port since I use Specialix boards. Consult
    the manpage on asy(7) to figure out which tty names to use.
    Note that there is a significant change between ISC3.0 and ISC4.0
    concerning the asy.
