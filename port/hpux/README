This port was done on an HP 9000/730 w/ HPUX 9.01 and HP C++.  I
wasn't able to try gcc 'cuz there was no libg++ installed (the
missing include files made it impossible to compile most of the
c++ code).

Notes:

o no cc -M to generate dependencies for mkdepend--I used gcc -M instead;
  beware that it generates a bunch of warnings that can be ignored
o /bin/sh's getopts doesn't seem to work so generic mkdepend fails;
  used Linux version that doesn't use getopts
o standard make can't hack Makefiles, must use gmake instead
o everything builds correctly, but couldn't test make install or
  faxadddmodem 'cuz I didn't have root permission
