$Header: /usr/people/sam/fax/port/aix32/RCS/README,v 1.4 1994/03/23 16:23:26 sam Exp $

This directory contains the files needed to port the FlexFax fax server to
the IBM RISC System/6000.  The environments under which this port is known
to compile are:

	RISC System/6000 models 3xx, 5xx and 9xx
	all versions of AIX between v3.2.3 extended and v3.2.5
	gcc v2.4.5 with g++ libraries v2.3.1 
		or
	gcc v2.5.8 with g++ libraries v2.5.3

I have tried to compile with libg++ v2.4 but without success.

There are several directories under this port directory.  The
gcc-related directory contains wrappers for system headers for use by gcc
during comilation of C++ code.  The redefinition of certain system functions
in unistd.h is intentional and avoids problems with prototyping under C++.
