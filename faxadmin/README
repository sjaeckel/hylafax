This is the start of a vadmin tool for dealing with
the facsimile server.  It had most of the important
stuff done for dealing with an installed server.  There's
no support for rearranging the send queue (but then
again, the print tool doesn't either).  Most glaring
is the need to support installation.  Help is also
not implemented and some of the UI stuff is inconsistent
with the rest of vadmin (use of menus on button 3).
