BH job group support is broken
B  file write errors during receive are not processed correctly
B  polling bug in Class 1 driver (reset FCF sndr/rcvr bit at start of Phase B)
B  no timeout in Class 1 receive if data is received when waiting for OK
   after transmit of TSI (happens easily if wrong receive baud rate setup)
B  sloppy processing of +FHNG: response to AT+FDT (extra read+timeout)
H  faxadduser program equivalent of SITE ADDUSER command
H  job archival support in faxqclean
H  revamp modem status to have a fixed format and include useful info
   like type, manufacturer, etc.
H  fill-in VRFY op to support least-cost routing over a WAN
H  use T.30 subaddress routing for received facsimile (needs database)
H  polled transmission of documents (use SEP and PWD; add registration
   tools and query status support)
H  use PWD in TSI qualification
H  select modems based on criteria such as destination phone number
   (for locations where some lines are capable of long distance calls
   while others are not)
H  voice support integration
H  VOICE/ANSWER button support for ZyXEL
H  silent answer support?
M  optionally replace info directory with a hashed database file to
   reduce overhead on busy systems
M  batch multiple jobs to the same destination (important for pages)
M  bound transmit page count on a per-user basis
M  add type of call control for CID access control list?
M  restructure modem classes to support multi-class modems (e.g. class 1+2)
M  add faxq lock to avoid naive users starting multiple queuers
BL race in queuer/Dispatcher collecting child process status (hack sleep
   in child to give parent time to install SIGCLD handler for now)
BL aborted receives get an extra page written (use TIFFUnlinkDirectory)
L  change receive timeout to be based on seeing EOL code
L  faxmove program, analogous to lpmove
L  permit call type deduction logic used when answering an inbound call to
   be user-configurable (useful for distinctive ring)--not so important now
   with configurable distinctive ring support builtin
O  DataPort<->MicroPorte wedges when retraining after EOM
X  add TOD control to TSI+CID access control lists? (no, can do this with
   cron job that sends FIFO messages to change control list files)

B = outright bug
O = observe (seen at least once but cannot reproduce)
H = high priority
M = medium priority
L = low priority
X = resolved
