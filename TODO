B  job queue tracing in faxq gets disabled after a while
B  replace DEV_PREFIX usage with _PATH_DEV
B  polling bug in Class 1 driver (reset FCF sndr/rcvr bit at start of Phase B)
?  should max send pages truncate job or terminate w/o sending?
B  ps2fax should limit the #pages generated according to maxsendpages;
   otherwise a large file can be created only to be rejected by the queuer
   (hard, requires mod to ghostscript et. al.)
B  no timeout in Class 1 receive if data is received when waiting for OK
   after transmit of TSI (happens easily if wrong receive baud rate setup)
B  not processing +FHNG: response to AT+FDT properly (extra read+timeout)
B? verify send_reformat processing done correctly
B? wtmp not updated on AIX after termination of data connection
   Steve Williams <steve@geniers.cuug.ab.ca>
B? bad UUCP lockfile permissions on AIX
   Steve Williams <steve@geniers.cuug.ab.ca>
B? DataPort<->MicroPorte wedges when retraining after EOM
H  faxq should automatically reread the config file
H  send notification when fax receive fails due to a protocol error
   with 0 pages received
H  accept parameters for programs specified in the config file so, for
   example, you can pass a -p option to faxsend
H  per-destination modem parameters such as ModemWaitForCarrier (pass from
   DestControls file down to send apps?)
H  per-destination capabilities restrictions made easier (restrict signalling
   rate to 9600 for overseas calls)
H  add jobid to xferlog file for charge back use
H  why does 2D decoder leave a0 set past EOL?
H  recv protocol additions from ctb; redo client-server protocol
   along the lines of ftp et. al.; complete api for integration
   with applications
H  replace IXO/TAP client-server protocol with SNPP per RFC1645
H  voice support integration
H  VOICE/ANSWER button support for ZyXEL
BM aborted receives get an extra page written to the
   file (use TIFFUnlinkDirectory)
BM race in queuer/Dispatcher collecting child process status (hack sleep
   in child for now)
BM fix line regeneration for modems that return EOLs not byte-aligned
BM fix tag line imaging for 2D-encoded source with EOLs not byte-aligned
M  batch multiple jobs to the same destination
M  redo accounting to be page-based so we can see per-page transfer
   characteristics and track errors better
M  bound transmit page count on a per-user basis
M  polled transmission of documents (can already poll to receive)
M  add TOD control to TSI+CID access control lists?
M  add type of call control for CID access control list?
M  calculate filled region of each page and transmit only the imaged
   area if the receiver is capable
M  restructure modem classes to support multi-class modems (e.g. class 1+2)
L  changing max send pages dynamically has no effect if job is already prepared
L  faxmove program, analogous to lpmove
L  support for new T.30 routing stuff
L  permit call type deduction logic used when answering an inbound call to
   be user-configurable (useful for distinctive ring)--not so important now
   with configurable distinctive ring support builtin

B = outright bug
H = high priority
M = medium priority
L = low priority
