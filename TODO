# These are recent to-do items that have been added.  (Time to manage this file again.)
#

ability to customize the date/time presentation in hfaxd/faxstat output
abort more quickly when client SUSP or DELE
speed up probemodem and faxaddmodem modem queries
teach hfaxd to use /etc/hosts.allow
encrypted communications would be nice, at least an MD5'ed password or something
Unfortunately, FaxModem::recvResetPage(TIFF) doesn't really work (anymore?).
sendfax -d -d -d or -z uses job groups now, but shouldn't repeat params
credible reports of faxmodem losing the modem after a while
PAM support doesn't include conversation interaction (pam_unix) or PAM_INCOMPLETE
if you abort a job during a call the "calls" notify report still says 0

If HylaFAX doesn't standardize internally on a particular bit orientation we will see problems on MSB2LSB systems 
in cutExtraEOFB as well as in the lastbyte zerobit counting because we'd come at the data from the wrong 
direction.  Check up on this.

Add the mimeconverters for faxmail-PDF by default.

# These are old (ancient, really) entries that deserve some investigation

BH job group support is broken
B  file write errors during receive are not processed correctly
B  polling bug in Class 1 driver (reset FCF sndr/rcvr bit at start of Phase B)
B  no timeout in Class 1 receive if data is received when waiting for OK
   after transmit of TSI (happens easily if wrong receive baud rate setup)
B  sloppy processing of +FHNG: response to AT+FDT (extra read+timeout)
H  fill-in VRFY op to support least-cost routing over a WAN
H  polled transmission of documents (use SEP and PWD; add registration
   tools and query status support)
H  use PWD in TSI qualification
H  voice support integration
H  VOICE/ANSWER button support for ZyXEL
M  optionally replace info directory with a hashed database file to
   reduce overhead on busy systems
M  add faxq lock to avoid naive users starting multiple queuers
BL race in queuer/Dispatcher collecting child process status (hack sleep
   in child to give parent time to install SIGCLD handler for now)
BL aborted receives get an extra page written (use TIFFUnlinkDirectory)
L  change receive timeout to be based on seeing EOL code
L  faxmove program, analogous to lpmove
L  permit call type deduction logic used when answering an inbound call to
   be user-configurable (useful for distinctive ring)--not so important now
   with configurable distinctive ring support builtin

       problem: MCF/RTN bug in the Class 2/2.0 driver
                the modem says "+FPTS: 2,2219,0,0" which means
                the page isn't good, ends phase C and ends phase C
                and reports "+FET: 2"; HylaFAX just ignores the PPR value
