modemused in q-file is not populated on requeues
ability to customize the date/time presentation in hfaxd/faxstat output
abort more quickly when client SUSP or DELE
speed up probemodem and faxaddmodem modem queries
teach hfaxd to use /etc/hosts.allow
encrypted communications would be nice, at least an MD5'ed password or something
Unfortunately, FaxModem::recvResetPage(TIFF) doesn't really work (anymore?).
sendfax -d -d -d or -z uses job groups now, but shouldn't repeat params
credible reports of faxmodem losing the modem after a while
if you abort a job during a call the "calls" notify report still says 0
Make clients poll the system for default page size rather than using a compiled-in default.

If HylaFAX doesn't standardize internally on a particular bit orientation we will see problems on MSB2LSB systems 
in cutExtraEOFB as well as in the lastbyte zerobit counting because we'd come at the data from the wrong 
direction.  Check up on this.

BH job group support is broken
B  file write errors during receive are not processed correctly
B  polling bug in Class 1 driver (reset FCF sndr/rcvr bit at start of Phase B)
H  fill-in VRFY op to support least-cost routing over a WAN
H  polled transmission of documents (use SEP and PWD; add registration
   tools and query status support)
H  use PWD in TSI qualification
H  voice support integration
H  VOICE/ANSWER button support for ZyXEL
M  optionally replace info directory with a hashed database file to
   reduce overhead on busy systems
M  add faxq lock to avoid naive users starting multiple queuers
BL race in queuer/Dispatcher collecting child process status (hack sleep
   in child to give parent time to install SIGCLD handler for now)
BL aborted receives get an extra page written (use TIFFUnlinkDirectory)
L  change receive timeout to be based on seeing EOL code
L  faxmove program, analogous to lpmove
L  permit call type deduction logic used when answering an inbound call to
   be user-configurable (useful for distinctive ring)--not so important now
   with configurable distinctive ring support builtin
