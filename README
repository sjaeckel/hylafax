FlexFAX, Version 0.9

About the System
----------------
This is a reasonably full-function facsimile service for SGI
systems.  One facsimile server process exists for each external
fax modem hooked to a serial port.  Client software spools
outgoing facsimile which are handled by the server processes.
Received facsimile are stored in a receive queue area and may
be automatically delivered by mail and/or printed.  Servers
are heavily parameterized through per-server configuration
files and through auxiliary shell scripts that perform
system-related operations (e.g. processing received facsimile,
converting PostScript to bitmap images for transmission).

The server requires a PostScript to bitmap facsimile conversion
utility for useful operation (otherwise, only bitmaps may be
transmitted.)  A Display PostScript-based imager is provided
for IRIX 4.0-based systems.  For other systems, a Ghoscript-based
version is included.

An administration tool that ``hooks into'' the system administration
facilities is provided.  While not complete, it provides easy
access to the most important administrative operations.

Note that you need a fax modem to use this software.  Two
types of modems are known to work:

    Abaton InterFax 24/96
    Class 2 modems, such as the Everex 24/96D

The first modem is common on Macintosh systems, while the
second modem is actually a class of modems that conform to
the "Class 2" host-modem interface standard.  The software
is known to work with the Everex modem, w/ firmware dated
October 5, 1990 or later.

Use and Propriety
-----------------
Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow me to give this work
away.  It is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any
sort as to its operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you
do anything useful with all or parts of it, I'd like to know
about it and, hopefully, be acknowledged.
