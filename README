This note is basically just a placeholder.  The real documentation is
online on the World Wide Web (WWW) at:

    http://www.vix.com/hylafax/

The online documentation includes the full contents of the
documentation as well as an FAQ, archives of the HylaFAX/flexfax
mailing list, and associated modem-related documentation.

You will find a subset of the online documentation in the html
subdirectory.  Beware however that timely information is usually more
up to date at www.vix.com than the materials in the html directory.
You can view the HTML documentation in place and/or configure it for
local installation through the configure script.


This note has the following sections:

    Installation
    Known Problems
    Upgrading from FlexFAX

Installation
------------
Follow the directions in the online documentation.  The main material
on configuring, building, and installing the software is given in:

    http://www.vix.com/hylafax/building.html

Server setup information is found at:

    http://www.vix.com/hylafax/setup.html

There is also an FAQ that covers (or should cover) common problems.

The basic procedure is:

    <unpack source code>
    % ./configure
    % make
    % su			# NB: must be root to install software
    # make install

If this does not work and the problem is not clear, then you will
need to look at the documentation and/or the code.


Known Problems in Setting up the Software
-----------------------------------------
The following setup problems are currently known; bugs or planned work
is documented in the TODO file or in the online (HTML) materials.

[This list should be sorted alphabetically.]

AIX with the IBM xlC C++ compiler:
   You need a version that supports the -+ option so that the .c++
   filenames are processed by the compiler.

Dell SVR4:
   On some releases <sys/mkdev.h> includes static functions with
   non-ANSI C definitions; these must be manually corrected before
   building the software.  (The GNU gcc installation procedure attempts
   to correct this file but does not.)

Dell and AT&T SVR4:
   The ttymon program is executable only by root; this causes the
   configure script to not select it as the getty program that is
   started up for inbound data calls.  Work around this problem by
   Overriding the default selection through the interactive prompts
   or through a config.local file.

FreeBSD 2.0:
   <osfcn.h> was omitted from the FreeBSD 2.0 distribution; it is needed
   to build the software.  A correct copy can be obtained from the GNU
   libg++ distribution: ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/libg++*.tar.gz,
   libg++-2.6.2/libg++/src/osfcn.h.

HPUX 9.05:
   The standard make incorrectly processes VPATH; either use gmake
   or configure builds in the source tree.

IRIX 5.3 with the SGI NCC C++ compiler:
   You need patch170 to correctly handle nested types (configure will
   ignore the compiler as unsuitable otherwise).

Linux (various versions):
   When linking with the -g option; if the linker complains about needing
   libc.so.4, then it is necessary to setup symbolic links in /usr/lib
   so that: libg.a -> libc.a and libg.sa -> libc.sa.

Solaris 2.3:
   The standard make does VPATH processing incorrectly for files
   passed to mkdepend (the last file in the list is not converted to
   a pathname relative to the source directory); this causes lots of
   msgs that can be safely ignored.

Ultrix 4.4:
   Extensive work is required to get the software built and working;
   consult the file README.ultrix for details.

Other stuff:

1. configure can get the signal handler type wrong on some systems;
   this should just cause warnings that can be ignored (or you can
   setup a SIGHANDLERTYPE definition in config.local)
2. configure can get confused by symbolic links when checking for
   existing programs and directories 'cuz test -d and test -x don't
   follow symbolic links; use config.local to force correct parameters
   if you encounter problems.
3. Many of the HTML files are not viewable directly from the html source
   directory because they include configuration-specific pathnames.
   Either view the materials from www.vix.com or use explicit pathnames
   to access particular files: e.g. xmosaic html/building.html.in
4. When building with DSOs disable the use of -lmalloc to avoid problems
   with symbol conflicts; use -with-LIBMALLOC=no or put appropriate info
   in a config.local file.
5. If you configure software installation in non-standard locations
   you may need to manually create some directories before doing make
   install (the default installation procedure does not create all
   the directories leading up to a target directory).


Upgrading from FlexFAX
----------------------
Note that if have been using a previous version FlexFAX that many
things have changed in incompatible ways.  Peruse the documentation.
The following is a list of potential things you should be aware of:

1. The old faxd server program is no longer present.  To get fax
   receive capability you must startup a faxgetty on each tty port that
   has a fax modem; typically this requires manual editing of the
   /etc/ttys or /etc/inittab file.  To get fax transmit capability you
   must startup the faxq scheduler process.
2. The modem command parameters in the server configuration files must
   have any "AT" and "AT+F" prefixes included in them (they were
   automatically prepended in older software).
3. The default server operation parameters set in config.h have changed;
   for example the default kill time for a fax job is now 3 hours
   instead of 24 hours.  Verify the parameters in config.h are what
   you want.
4. The client-server protocol has changed.  New client applications
   cannot communicate with older servers but older clients *can*
   communicate with the newer servers.  In particular this means that
   you can still use the existing Mac and Windows clients.
5. Numerous pathnames may have changed.  The source-based installation
   procedure does not remove previously installed files unless they
   are to be overwritten; this can result in multiple versions
   of applications such as faxaddmodem being installed.  Verify the
   parameters used for installation; you may want to tailor them to
   your environment by creating a config.local file with local
   configuration parameters.
6. HylaFAX includes an improved install.sh script that is used to
   install files on non-IRIX systems.  Certain files in the distribution
   are treated as configuration-specific files and are not overwritten
   if they appear to have local modifications.  Instead the install.sh
   script will install the new file with a ".N" suffix and print a
   warning message.  Be sure to reconcile these conflicts by comparing
   the old and new file contents with a program like diff(1); in most
   cases you should incorporate any local modifications into the new
   file and install it for use.


Use and Copyright
-----------------
Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow me to give this work away.  It
is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its
operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you do anything useful with
all or parts of it you need to honor the copyright notices.   I would
also be interested in knowing about it and, hopefully, be acknowledged.

The regular expression support is based on Henry Spencer's POSIX 1003.2
compliant regex package that has ``Copyright 1992, 1993, 1994 Henry

The code to read PCF fonts is distantly related to the X11R5 code
that is ``Copyright 1990 Massachusetts Institute of Technology''; consult
faxd/PCFFont.c++ for the full copyright notice.

The textfmt program is distantly related to the lptops program written
by Nelson Beebe; there was no copyright notice on the version of the code
that textfmt grew out of.

The config.guess and config.sub scripts are part of the GNU autoconf
package and covered by the GNU Public License (GPL).  Several ideas
in the configure script are directly "borrowed" from autoconf (and I
have tried to maintain as much compatibility as possible).

HylaFAX Mailing List and Other Final Words (where to send bugs)
---------------------------------------------------------------
There is documentation!  There is GOBS of documentation.  When in doubt
read the manual pages.  There are manual pages for all the programs and
manual pages for all the files and directories that you may be curious
about.  Of course there is also source code for everything, but this
should (hopefully) not be needed.  A useful introduction to the client
applications is given in hylafax(1).  If you want to learn how the
server and spooling system work, look first at hylafax(4F).

A mailing list for users of this software is located on sgi.com.
If you want to join this mailing list or have a list-related request
such as getting your name removed from it, send your request to

    flexfax-request@sgi.com

(FYI, "flexfax" is the old name for this software).  For example, to
subscribe, send the line "subscribe" in the body of your message.  The
line "help" will return a list of the commands understood by the
mailing list management software.  You can also use the online format at

    http://www.vix.com/hylafax/mailing-lists.html

to subscribe.

Submissions to the mailing list (including bug reports) should be
directed to:

    flexfax@sgi.com

Note that the mailing list has many people on it.  Please take this
into consideration when posting notes to it; i.e. avoid posting large
trace logs and the such.  Also, when corresponding about this software
please always specify:

- what version you have (see "How to tell which version you have" above),
- what system you're running on, and,
- if the problem is modem-related, identify it and the firmware rev

For example: "HylaFAX v3.0beta99 under Solaris 2.3 with gcc 2.6.3;
ZyXEL 1496E with 6.11a firmware."

If you find the flexfax mailing list to have too much traffic for you,
there is also an announcements-only mailing list called flexfax-announce.
This can be subscribed to by sending mail flexfax-announce-request@sgi.com;
include the single line "subscribe" in the body of the message.  Note
that there is no need to subscribe to both mailing lists; postings to
the announcement list are automatically fed to the normal flexfax list.

If you have not previously done so, please submit the survey form at

    http://www.vix.com/hylafax/survey.html

This form provides me with information on the modems and systems that
HylaFAX is being used with.  The information is just to help me diagnose
problems; all information is kept strictly private.
