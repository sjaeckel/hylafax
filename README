Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow me to give this work away.  It
is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its
operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you do anything useful with
all or parts of it you need to honor the copyright notices.   I would
also be interested in knowing about it and, hopefully, be acknowledged.

Finally, note that this software is called ``HylaFAX'', not ``Hylafax'',
``hylafax'', and certainly not ``FlexFAX'' (the old name which someone
else has a copyright on).  If you want to refer to this software use
``HylaFAX (tm)'' and be sure to honor the Silicon Graphics trademark.
